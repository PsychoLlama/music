      <p>
        When building an HTML5 music player, you'll want some way to manage
        your songs.
        This library is a newbie's interpretation to how it should be done.
      </p>
      
      <h2>
        To begin:
      </h2>
      <p>
        To make a playlist, we create a new instance:
        <code><span class="token">var</span> playlist
        = <span class="token">new</span>
        Playlist(<span class="arg">'Awesome Songs'</span>)</code>.
        Our new playlist object has a lot of useful tools built in. Let's
        take a look...<br>
      </p>
      
      <h3>
        playlist.add()
      </h3>
      <p>
        How much use is a playlist without
        songs? Pass in either an <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> node, an object
        or a whole array of objects. <code>add()</code> is pretty flexible.
<pre>{
  title: "Yellow Submarine",
  src: "path/to/submarine.mp3",
  img: "path/to/albumCover.png"
}</pre>
        Song.js automatically converts your objects into working
        <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> elements, and pushes them to an array
        used by the built-in in tools.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="doc brown">
      
      <h3>
        playlist.play()/pause()
        
      </h3>
      <p>
        Now that you've got your playlist set up, kick it into gear
        with the <code>play()</code> method. If the awesome is too
        overwhelming, <code>pause()</code> has your back.
      </p>
      
      <h3>
          playlist.next()/previous()
      </h3>
      <p>
        <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> elements allow for some
        nightmarish behavior. If you're using sound effects, you might
        want concurrency. But that's a horrible idea with music. Song.js
        makes sure only one song is playing at a time, and it does that
        with <code>next()</code> and <code>previous()</code>.<br>
        Both methods change the song without actually playing it,
        giving you finer control over your app.
      </p>
      
      <h3>
        playlist.repeat(boolean)
      </h3>
      <p>
        After fiddling with <code>next</code> and <code>previous</code>,
        you probably noticed that <code>undefined</code> returns
        at your playlists' edges. You can break these borders by
        turning on repeat: <code>repeat(true)</code>.
        To see what it's set at, just ask <code>repeat()</code>.
      </p>
      
      <h3>
        playlist.shuffle()
      </h3>
      <p>
        Get some variety with the <code>shuffle()</code> method.
        Each song gets ordered randomly in the playlist after this
        code is run.<br>
        Warning: you may want to consider a few things first...
        <ul>
          <li>Initial state will be lost.</li>
          <li>The current song will reset, and likely change
          to another.</li>
        </ul>
        These issues should be solved in a future release.
      </p>
      
      <h3>
        playlist.skipTo(songNumber)
      </h3>
      <p>
        <code>next</code> and <code>previous</code> barely touched
        your incredible thirst for power. You want more, and you'll find
        it with <code>skipTo</code>. Passing in the index of any
        song in the playlist changes your current song to your
        chosen one.
      </p>
      
      <h3>
        playlist.remove(songNumber)
      </h3>
      <p>
        The power to destroy, now in your hands. Call <code>remove</code>
        on a song index and the playlist will violently comply, even
        cleaning up the falsy values left behind.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Uber cool tip</strong><br>
        All the methods mentioned above can be <i>chained</i>. Check it
        out:
        
<pre><span class="token">new</span> Playlist(<span class="arg">"60's Mashup"</span>)
  .add(<span class="arg">songs</span>)
  .repeat(<span class="arg">true</span>)
  .skipTo(<span class="arg">3</span>)
  .play()</pre>
  
      </p>
      
      <h3>
        playlist.title(song)
      </h3>
      <p>
        Grab the title of a song. If it wasn't passed a song, it just
        grabs the current one. If you didn't define a
        title when you added the song, it will return
        <code>undefined</code>.
      </p>
      
      <h3>
        playlist.album(song)
      </h3>
      <p>
        Pretty much the same thing as <code>playlist.title()</code>,
        although it returns an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag complete
        with the src you defined (you defined that, right?)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Warning:</strong><br>
        The <code>album</code> and <code>title</code> methods may be
        implemented differently in the future.
      </p>
      
      <h3>
        playlist.getSong(songNumber)
      </h3>
      <p>
        Grabs the song at the songNumber/index passed in. It's forgiving
        and will return the current song if you didn't give it an index.
        This method is really useful for looping (more on this later).
      </p>
      
      <h3>
        playlist.songChange(callback)
      </h3>
      <p>
        <code>next</code>, <code>previous</code>, <code>skipTo</code>
        and others generate songChange events. Give songChange your
        listener function, and every time it fires we'll call it for you.
        You can register an unlimited number of listeners, and each is
        passed the current <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> node.
      </p>
      
      <h3>
        playlist.Each(callback)
      </h3>
      <p>
        Just what it sounds like. For every song in the playlist,
        invoke the callback with that same song and it's index. Example:
<pre>playlist.each(<span class="arg">callback</span>);

<span class="token">function</span> callback(<span class="arg">song</span>, <span class="arg">index</span>) {
  $( <span class="arg">'&lt;li&gt;'</span> )
  .text( <span class="arg">playlist.title(song)</span> )
  .append( <span class="arg">'#playlist'</span> )
  .click( <span class="token">function</span>() {
  
    playlist.skipTo(<span class='arg'>index</span>);
    
  });
});</pre>
      </p>

        <strong>You made it</strong><br>
        Congrats! You've read every scrap of Song.js documentation. If
        you haven't already, give it a try and let me know what you
        think. I'd love to hear from you!
